In this page, I show the "Probabilistic Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2" assignments. It's an advanced course, given by the London Imperial College and hosted in Coursera, that I am particularly proud of. It focuses on the use of the TensorFlow Probability library.

TensorFlow Probability (TFP) is a Python library built on TensorFlow that makes it easy to combine probabilistic models and deep learning on modern hardware (TPU, GPU). It's for data scientists, statisticians, ML researchers, and practitioners who want to encode domain knowledge to understand data and make predictions. TFP includes:
<ul>
  <li>A wide selection of probability distributions and bijectors.</li>
  <li>Tools to build deep probabilistic models, including probabilistic layers and a `JointDistribution` abstraction.</li>
  <li>Variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo.</li>
  <li>Optimizers such as Nelder-Mead, BFGS, and SGLD.</li>
</ul>
